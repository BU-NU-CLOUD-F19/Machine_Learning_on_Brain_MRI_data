# Machine_Learning_on_Brain_MRI_data

## 1. Vision and goals of the project

We will develop two containarized applications that run on ChRIS cloud computing platform as well as work as standalone applications to help segment brain MRI data for researchers.

High level goals include

* A containerized application that trains convolutional network using precomputed features to optimize a model to perform brain region segmentation

* A containerized application that will use this pretrained model to segment new images


## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project
